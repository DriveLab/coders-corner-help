# Drive Lab Coders' Corner

Hi! and welcome to the Drive Lab Coders' Corner. This platform (GitHub calls it a *Repo*) contains up-to-date programs to implement techniques that are used across different projects (calculating indices, trimming or winsorizing, etc.). 

Together with the [Drive Lab Coders' Best Practice Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_O0SiyN1AAlTNnpYiN5TNaeGCnhgc2uKr0enuORYHE/edit), which provides guidance on how to implement techniques in different circumstances and documents problems you might run into, the platform serves four main purposes:

1. It ensures that techniques are used consistently across different projects.

2. It documents and offers solutions to problems you might run into.

3. It provides code to implement the best-practice approach for various stages of the research process, from cleaning the data to producing neat output tables.

4. It aggregates the know-how of all collaborators and makes it available to the Drive Lab community.


## Your contribution matters

- For yourself, because the better maintained the programs on this platform are, the better the platform can serve the functions above and help you produce better research in less time.

- For the community, because everyone relies on everyone else to contribute and to share their knowledge.


## Help with using GitHub

If you're new to GitHub, have a look at the [resources provided by IPA](https://github.com/PovertyAction/github-training). A great way to get started quickly is to read [*GitHub User Guide.md*](https://github.com/PovertyAction/github-training/blob/master/resources/GitHub%20User%20Guide.md) in the resources directory. To delve deeper, have a look at [*External learning resources.md*](https://github.com/PovertyAction/github-training/blob/master/resources/External%20resources.md), and check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) website. 



## How to use the platform

If you haven't worked with GitHub before, some of the steps below will be gibberish. Have a look at [this Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/), and in 4 minutes from now, it will all make sense. 


### Use a program from the platform

1. Copy the Coders' Corner repo to your own GitHub.com account (fork the repo).

2. Download that copy from GitHub.com to GitHub Desktop to have a local copy (clone the repo).

3. Each program (together with documentation and auxiliary files) is saved in a separate subfolder of the code folder. Copy the program you need into the analysis/code folder of your project and adapt it for your purposes.


### Propose changes to a program

If you find bugs in the code or make improvements that could benefit the community:

1. Change the in your local copy.

2. Push the change to your fork of the Coders' Corner on your GitHub.com account (that you produced in step 1 above).

3. Propose a change to the original code (make a pull request).


### Suggest that your program gets added to the platform

If you use a program that is not on the platform yet but that could be useful for others, add a new folder into the code directory of your fork of the Coders' Corner and propose that the program be added to the platform (make a pull request). A few rules to follow to ensure consistency across all programs:

- Use lower-case for all letters, and hyphens instead of spaces in all directory- and file names (consistent use of lower- and upper case makes folders and documents easier to skim, spaces make it cumbersome to use GitHub from the command-line). 

- Choose a meaningful name for the directory (mean-comparison) and for all files (mean-comparison.do, example-data.dta, readme.md).

- Add relevant literature in a separate *lit* subfolder.

- Add a readme.md file that explains what your directory contains, what all the files do, and how to deal with known issues. Provide a link to the relevant section of the [Best Practice Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_O0SiyN1AAlTNnpYiN5TNaeGCnhgc2uKr0enuORYHE/edit) if you give more detail there (it would be nice if you did!). 

For an example, see [here](https://github.com/fabiangunzinger/drivelab-code/tree/master/code/stata-latex-integration).


### Request that a new program gets added to the platform.

If you think there is a program that would be useful to have on the platform but don't have time to write it yourself just now, raise an [issue](https://github.com/fabiangunzinger/drivelab-code/issues) and label it as an *enhancement*.
